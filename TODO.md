## Short term

- Implement enough functionality to port the BCC tutorial examples in PythonBPF
- Add all maps
- XDP support in pylibbpf
- ringbuf support
- recursive expression resolution

## Long term

- Refactor the codebase to be better than a hackathon project
- Port to C++ and use actual LLVM?
